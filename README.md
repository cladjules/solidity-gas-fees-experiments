**Experiments on optimising gas fees on Solidity**

A few Solidity functions written in different ways,
to highlight how they can easily be optimized in order to reduce gas fees.

The last few methods show in what cases, you can use `storage` vs `memory` depending on how many times you variables are accessed.


Here are the results:
